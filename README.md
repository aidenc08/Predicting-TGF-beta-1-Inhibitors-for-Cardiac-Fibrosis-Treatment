# Predicting-TGF-beta-1-Inhibitors-for-Cardiac-Fibrosis-Treatment

Fibrotic diseases are dangerous conditions
that cause the deaths of more than 800,000 people each
year. One very prevalent type of fibrotic disease is car-
diac fibrosis, which is also classified as a cardiovascular
disease (CVD). Cardiac fibrosis is a dangerous disease
caused by the overproduction of fibroblasts, crucial
cells that play large roles in creating proteins and heal-
ing wounds. These cells produce extracellular matrices
(ECMs), connective tissues whose over-accumulation
can impair the function of the myocardium. One way to
prevent the accumulation of ECM in the myocardium
is by inhibiting the function of proteins such as trans-
forming growth factor-beta receptor type 1 (TGF-β1),
whose overexpression results in the overproduction of
fibroblasts. Unfortunately, there are very few drugs
currently in circulation that attempt to inhibit the
function of TGF-β1. Past studies attempting to dis-
cover new inhibitory drugs, whether in vivo, in vitro,
or in silico, have often revolved around modeling the
heart and have encountered many limitations including
a lack of complexity and applicability. Instead, this
study focuses on using publicly available chemical data
to train machine learning predictors. We tested the
hypothesis that the efficacy of potential TGF-β1 in-
hibitors can be assessed through the use of traditional
and natural language processing regressors solely using
the SMILES notation and Lipinski descriptors of chem-
ical compounds. These models achieved R2 scores up
to 0.62 and showed immense promise as potential tools
in the process of cardiovascular drug discovery.
